# Exercise 12 - Hanging the Man!

Finally, it's time to implement the animation of the hanging man.

Look at the `DeadMan` component and uncomment the `/* stroke: transparent; */`. This will _hide_ the man from screen.

Notice that each bodypart has a class associated with it.

These classnames are also available in an array in `data/body-parts.json`.

Add functionality to the `handleGuess` function that will show a bodypart for every wrong answer provided by the user.
