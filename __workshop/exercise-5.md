# Exercise 5 - Dead Letters

Create a new state for `wrongGuesses` in `App.js`. It should have an initial value of `[]`.

```js
const [wrongGuesses, setWrongGuesses] = useState([]);
```

Pass this array to the `DeadLetters` component and render those letters in the red box on the screen.

_Add a few letters to initial array to test your component(s)._
