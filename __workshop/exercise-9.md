# Exercise 9 - Resetting the Game

Write a function called `handleReset` that will _handle the reset_ of the game. It should be triggered by clicking on `BTN 2`, which you should re-label as "Reset".

Make sure to get a new word and reset all of the app data to its initial state, except the `started` flag; that should stay `true` so that the user can immediately start a new game.
