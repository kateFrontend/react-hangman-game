# Exercise 6 - The Keyboard

Time to build out the keyboard! Take a look at the `Keyboard` and `LetterKey` components. You will use these to generate the keyboard.

There is also a data file `data/letters.json` that contains an array of the letters of the alphabet to give something to _map_ over.

You should have this when you're done.
